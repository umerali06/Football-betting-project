# Note: These API keys are optional but will significantly improve
# the system's ability to fetch real-time data instead of using sample data.
# The system will work without them but will fall back to sample data more often.

# To use these keys:
# 1. Create a .env file in your project root
# 2. Add the keys above with your actual API keys
# 3. The system will automatically detect and use them
# 4. This will reduce sample data usage and improve real-time analysis
